Digital twins represent a particularly impactful innovation in BCP, allowing organizations to simulate supply chain networks in a virtual environment. Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical supply chain assets and processes, which enable companies to test and refine their BCP strategies in a controlled, risk-free setting. For example, a company might use a digital twin to simulate the effects of a port closure on its distribution network, exploring alternative routes and suppliers to assess the potential impact and recovery strategies. By experimenting with different disruption scenarios, digital twins help organizations identify vulnerabilities, evaluate response options, and refine their continuity plans based on realistic simulations. This approach is especially valuable for companies operating in emerging economies, where digital twins can provide insight into local supply chain challenges, allowing organizations to optimize their resilience strategies without risking actual operations.
