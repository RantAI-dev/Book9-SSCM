<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another best practice for scaling smart supply chains is the use of agile methodologies. Agile methodologies promote a collaborative, incremental approach to project management, allowing teams to iterate quickly and respond to feedback from each phase of the rollout. For example, a company implementing an IoT-enabled asset tracking system may begin with a small deployment in one region, refine the solution based on real-world insights, and gradually scale it across other regions. This agile, phased approach not only minimizes risks but also ensures that the solution is optimized for diverse operating environments. In emerging markets, where supply chains may face unique challenges such as limited infrastructure or regulatory constraints, agile methodologies allow companies to adapt their strategies and tailor solutions to local conditions.
